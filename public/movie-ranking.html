<h2>Top Three Movies That Didn't Waste My Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>
    Gone Girl
</h3>

<p>
    I am good at predicting series of events when I watch movies and I liked Gone Girl 
    because I did not see that coming.
</p>

<h3>
    Captain America: The First Avenger
</h3>

<p>
    I like how wholesome Steve Rogers is and the Caaptain America identity pureness That
    resonates with me was so perfectly executed in this movie.
</p>

<h3>
    22 Jump Street
</h3>

<p>
    Everything. There isn't a single thing I don't love about this movie. Top tier humor.
    Maybe the best writing Jonah Hill has ever done.
